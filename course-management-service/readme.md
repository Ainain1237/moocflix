MoocFlix: A mooc streaming platform
course-management-service is going to be a microservice which is going to carry out these tasks:

Course Creation/Editing: Allow instructors to create and update courses, upload content, and set course structures (modules, quizzes, assignments).
Course Catalog: Display available courses with metadata like categories, ratings, and instructor information.
Enrollment Service: Handle student enrollment and course progress tracking​.

the structure is going to look like this:
/course-management-service
│
├── /src
│   ├── /controllers         # Handle HTTP requests (create course, update course)
│   ├── /models              # Define Course schema/model
│   ├── /services            # Business logic (course CRUD operations)
│   ├── /routes              # API routes for course management (e.g., /courses)
│   └── /middlewares         # Validation and permission checks
│
├── /config                  # Environment configurations
├── /tests                   # Unit and integration tests
├── package.json             # Dependencies and scripts
└── Dockerfile               # Docker setup


these are going to be the routes:
POST   /api/v1/courses/create                                     // Instructor creates a new course
PUT    /api/v1/courses/:courseId/update                           // Update course details

Course Management Service:


Format:

the **Course Management Service** will interact with other services and the logic behind each route. The **Course Management Service** primarily handles course creation, updates, and enrollment, and communicates with services like **User Management** (for validating user roles and permissions) and **Assessment Service** (to sync with course changes).

---

### 1. **POST /api/v1/courses/create**
- **Flow**:
  1. **Instructor Authentication**: The **Course Management Service** calls the **User Management Service** to authenticate the instructor's identity (via a token) and validate the user’s role (instructor/admin).
  2. **Course Creation**: Once validated, the service stores the course details (name, description, etc.) in its database.
  3. **Sync with Assessment**: A message is sent to **Kafka** (Topic: `Course-Creation`) so the **Assessment Service** can prepare itself for any potential quizzes/assignments related to this course.
- **Response**: Course ID and success message.

---

### 2. **PUT /api/v1/courses/:courseId/update**
- **Flow**:
  1. **Course Validation**: The service checks if the course exists by querying its database.
  2. **Instructor Validation**: The service calls the **User Management Service** to check if the requesting user has the necessary privileges (course creator or admin).
  3. **Update Course Details**: The service updates the course's metadata.
  4. **Kafka Sync**: A message (`Course-Updated`) is sent to Kafka, notifying services like **Assessment** and **Notification Service**.
- **Response**: Success message.

---

### 3. **GET /api/v1/courses/:courseId**
- **Flow**:
  1. The service retrieves the course's details from the database.
  2. No external service calls are required.
- **Response**: Course details (name, description, instructor, etc.).

---

### 4. **GET /api/v1/courses**
- **Flow**:
  1. **Fetch All Courses**: Retrieves the list of all available courses from the database.
  2. This route does not involve external service interactions.
- **Response**: List of courses.

---

### 5. **DELETE /api/v1/courses/:courseId/delete**
- **Flow**:
  1. **Course Validation**: The service checks if the course exists in the database.
  2. **Permission Check**: The **User Management Service** is called to verify that the user is either the course creator or an admin.
  3. **Delete Course**: The service removes the course from the database.
  4. **Kafka Notification**: A `Course-Deleted` event is published to Kafka, informing the **Assessment Service** to remove related assessments.
- **Response**: Success message.

---

### 6. **POST /api/v1/courses/:courseId/enroll**
- **Flow**:
  1. **Course Existence Check**: The service checks if the course exists.
  2. **Student Validation**: Calls the **User Management Service** to verify the user’s role and eligibility to enroll in the course.
  3. **Enrollment**: Once validated, the service records the enrollment in the database.
  4. **Kafka Event**: The **Course Management Service** triggers an event (`Student-Enrolled`) to inform services like **Assessment** and **Notification**.
- **Response**: Enrollment success.

---

### 7. **GET /api/v1/courses/:courseId/modules**
- **Flow**:
  1. **Course Validation**: Check if the course exists.
  2. **Fetch Modules**: Retrieve the course's modules from the database.
- **Response**: List of course modules.

---

### 8. **GET /api/v1/courses/:courseId/students**
- **Flow**:
  1. **Course Validation**: Check if the course exists.
  2. **List Students**: Retrieve the list of students enrolled in the course.
- **Response**: List of students.

---

### 9. **POST /api/v1/courses/:courseId/modules/create**
- **Flow**:
  1. **Course Validation**: The service checks if the course exists.
  2. **Instructor Validation**: The service calls the **User Management Service** to ensure the user is the course creator or an admin.
  3. **Create Module**: The service adds the new module to the course in the database.
  4. **Kafka Event**: A `Module-Creation` event is sent to notify other services (like the **Assessment Service**).
- **Response**: Success message.

---

### 10. **PUT /api/v1/courses/:courseId/modules/:moduleId/update**
- **Flow**:
  1. **Course & Module Validation**: Check if the course and the module exist.
  2. **Permission Check**: Ensure the user is the course creator.
  3. **Update Module**: Update the module details in the database.
  4. **Kafka Notification**: An update event is sent to Kafka (`Module-Updated`).
- **Response**: Success message.

---

### 11. **DELETE /api/v1/courses/:courseId/modules/:moduleId/delete**
- **Flow**:
  1. **Course & Module Validation**: Check if the course and module exist.
  2. **Permission Check**: Ensure the user is authorized to delete (course creator/admin).
  3. **Delete Module**: Remove the module from the database.
  4. **Kafka Notification**: A `Module-Deleted` event is sent to Kafka, notifying the **Assessment Service** to clean up any related assessments.
- **Response**: Success message.

---

### Course Management Service Workflow with Kafka

1. **Course Creation**:
   - When a course is created, a message (`Course-Creation`) is sent to Kafka.
   - The **Assessment Service** subscribes to this topic to prepare for any quizzes/assignments associated with this course.

2. **Enrollment Sync**:
   - When a student enrolls in a course, the **Course Management Service** emits a `Student-Enrolled` event to Kafka.
   - The **Assessment Service** listens for this event to ensure students can take assessments.

3. **Module Updates**:
   - Module creation, updates, and deletions trigger Kafka events that the **Assessment Service** subscribes to.
   - This ensures that course assessments are updated or deleted in sync with module changes.

---

### Summary of How Each Route Works

- The **Course Management Service** interacts with the **User Management Service** for user verification and role-based access control.
- Kafka is used for asynchronous communication with services like the **Assessment Service** to ensure that course-related assessments and quizzes are synced.
- Each route handles its own responsibility of interacting with the database, validating input, and triggering Kafka events to maintain a decoupled architecture.

This architecture ensures scalability, fault tolerance (with Kafka), and ease of management for complex course-related interactions.
