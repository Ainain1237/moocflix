MoocFlix: A mooc streaming platform
course-management-service is going to be a microservice which is going to carry out these tasks:

Course Creation/Editing: Allow instructors to create and update courses, upload content, and set course structures (modules, quizzes, assignments).
Course Catalog: Display available courses with metadata like categories, ratings, and instructor information.
Enrollment Service: Handle student enrollment and course progress tracking​.

the structure is going to look like this:
/course-management-service
│
├── /src
│   ├── /controllers         # Handle HTTP requests (create course, update course)
│   ├── /models              # Define Course schema/model
│   ├── /services            # Business logic (course CRUD operations)
│   ├── /routes              # API routes for course management (e.g., /courses)
│   └── /middlewares         # Validation and permission checks
│
├── /config                  # Environment configurations
├── /tests                   # Unit and integration tests
├── package.json             # Dependencies and scripts
└── Dockerfile               # Docker setup


these are going to be the routes:
POST   /api/v1/courses/create             // Instructor creates a new course
PUT    /api/v1/courses/:courseId/update   // Update course details
GET    /api/v1/courses/:courseId          // Get details of a specific course
GET    /api/v1/courses                    // List all available courses
DELETE /api/v1/courses/:courseId/delete   // Delete a course (instructor/admin)
POST   /api/v1/courses/:courseId/enroll   // Enroll a student in a course
GET    /api/v1/courses/:courseId/modules  // Get course modules/sections



Course Management Service:
Used by:
Content Delivery Service: To fetch course details and validate whether a user has access to course materials.
Assessment & Grading Service: To check which quizzes or assignments are associated with a course.
User Management Service: To retrieve course enrollment data or check if a user is enrolled.
API Used:
/api/v1/courses/:courseId
/api/v1/courses/:courseId/enrollments

Format:

Content Delivery and Assessment & Grading Services use the Course Management API.
User Management uses the Course Management API to check enrollments.


Course Management Service
Event Produced: When a new course is created or updated (course_created, course_updated events).

Event Consumed: When a user enrolls in a course (user_enrolled event).

Kafka Flow:

The Course Management Service publishes events like course_created or course_updated to notify other microservices about new or updated courses.
The Content Delivery Service can consume these events to link new content to courses.
